Project Problem Statement:
“Live life with no excuses, travel with no regret” – Oscar Wilde. Many travelers plan to travel different places around the world during different times of the year. Planning the travel is a major work. Once the traveler decides the location of his travel, he must check individually with each travel agency for itinerary and the budget. Which consumes lot of time. Due to which the user will end up visiting few websites. If more travel plans are available under single platform then there is exposure for various travel companies and their plans. 
Proposed Solution/Project Idea:
Wouldn’t it be easier if somebody planned your trip? And all you must do it pack and leave. In this platform, all you must do is to mention your specifications. To make this happen both users and travel agency will have to register with the platform.
