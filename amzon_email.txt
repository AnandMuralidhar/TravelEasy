We have detected activity that indicates your AWS account has been compromised. To learn more about what this means, and for detailed instructions to re-secure your account, please read https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/potential-account-compromise/.

Unfortunately we have been unable to reach you by phone. To re-secure your account you must update your root account password and rotate and delete your AWS Access Keys and respond to this notification within five days.

Check your account for unauthorized usage in all regions by using the dropdown menu at the top right corner of your console. Commonly targeted resources in EC2 are spot instances and on-demand instances. Please also review your IAM users, AMIs, EBS volumes and snapshots, and delete any you donâ€™t recognize.

To protect you from unauthorized usage and charges, failure to reply or follow these steps within the requested time period may result in the suspension of your account, and/or disruption of AWS service.

When you have taken the recommended steps, or if you require any assistance with this process, please notify us by replying to this case in your Support Center. If you prefer to speak directly with an agent over the phone, please find this case in your Support Center (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home ), then click the "Phone" button and we will be in touch as soon as possible.
